# "Ten things to make you go oooooh! ... in R"

This repository contains all of the materials for a talk that was given to the EdinbR User Group on Thu 27 Mar 2025.

# Description of Talk

Nevil will demonstrate ten different RStudio settings and coding choices that he now uses on a regular basis, which help make data analysis an even more fulfilling experience than it already is. He hopes that during this 20 minute talk, every audience member will go 'oooooh!' at least once. If they don't, then the title of this talk was wildly over-optimistic.
